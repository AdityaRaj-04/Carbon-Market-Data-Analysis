# Carbon-Market-Data-Analysis
I completed this project using MS Excel, Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and created a dynamic dashboard with Power BI, with some assistance from ChatGPT.
This project analyzes carbon market data to identify trading patterns, pricing trends, and market dynamics, using data visualization and statistical techniques to provide insights into carbon credits.
